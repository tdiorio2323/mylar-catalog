## Estimated Timeline

**Fastest Path to MVP: 8 weeks**

| Phase | Duration | Blockers |
|-------|----------|----------|
| Core Testing | 1 week | None (can start now) |
| Stripe | 1 week | Need API keys |
| Identity | 1 week | Vendor approval (Onfido/Veriff) |
| Screening | 1 week | Vendor approval (Checkr) |
| Contracts | 1 week | DocuSign setup |
| Email | 3 days | None |
| Compliance | 1 week | Legal review |
| Production | 1 week | Build issues resolved |

**Total: ~8 weeks to production-ready MVP**

---

## Risk Mitigation

### High Risk
1. **Vendor approvals** (Checkr, Onfido) can take 1-2 weeks
   - Mitigation: Apply early, have backups (Certn, Veriff)

2. **FCRA compliance** errors can result in lawsuits
   - Mitigation: Legal review mandatory, use Checkr's compliance tools

3. **PII data breach** would be catastrophic
   - Mitigation: RLS policies, encryption at rest, regular audits

### Medium Risk
1. **Google Fonts build issue** blocks production
   - Mitigation: Host fonts locally (documented in CLAUDE.md)

2. **Stripe webhook failures** could lose payment data
   - Mitigation: Implement retry logic, manual reconciliation process

---

## Next Immediate Action

**üëâ Start with Phase 1, Task 1:**

Open: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/dotfloiygvhsujlwzqgv/auth/providers

Toggle "Email" to ON. Then test sign-in at http://localhost:3000.

That's it! You're on your way to MVP. üöÄ
